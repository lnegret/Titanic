Within the "train" dataset, there are records of individuals who traveled aboard the Titanic. A machine learning model is developed to predict the data found in the "test" file. Predictions regarding passenger survival are associated with "PassengerId" and "Survived," denoting "0" if the passenger perishes or "1" if the passenger survives. The "workspace" file is utilized for data analysis and model creation.
